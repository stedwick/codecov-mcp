# Codecov MCP Server Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus of the Codecov MCP Server project is on implementing and refining the core functionality of identifying files with low test coverage. The server has been successfully implemented and can now:

1. Detect Git repository information from remote URLs
2. Connect to the Codecov API to retrieve coverage data
3. Analyze the data to identify files with low coverage
4. Return a ranked list of files that need better test coverage

Recent work has focused on ensuring the server correctly implements the MCP protocol, particularly the proper method names for JSON-RPC communication.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented the core MCP server using the MCP SDK
- Created the `find_low_coverage_files` tool
- Added automatic Git repository detection
- Implemented comprehensive logging for debugging
- Fixed issues with JSON-RPC method names (using `tools/list` and `tools/call` instead of `list_tools` and `call_tool`)
- Created test scripts to verify server functionality
- Implemented a mock Codecov API server for testing
- Cleaned up test files by removing unnecessary console.error statements, keeping only those that log actual errors

## Next Steps
The following areas are being considered for future development:

1. **Flaky Test Detection**: Implement a tool to identify tests that are inconsistent or flaky
2. **Branch Comparison**: Add functionality to compare coverage between branches
3. **Visualization Capabilities**: Provide visual representations of coverage data
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error messages and recovery mechanisms
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for Codecov API requests
6. **Caching**: Add caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
7. **Additional Authentication Methods**: Support alternative authentication methods beyond API tokens

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Logging Strategy
The server now implements a more focused logging approach:
- Console errors are only used for actual error conditions
- Informational and debug logs are handled separately from error logs
- Test files have been cleaned up to only log actual errors, improving readability of test output

### Authentication
Currently, the server uses a simple API token for authentication with Codecov. This approach was chosen for its simplicity and ease of implementation. Alternative authentication methods may be considered in the future.

### Error Handling
The server implements comprehensive error handling, with detailed error messages and appropriate error codes. This approach helps users understand and resolve issues more easily.

### Testing Strategy
Testing is a critical aspect of the project, with a focus on:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for the complete server
- Mock server for testing without actual Codecov API calls

### Performance Considerations
The server is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with minimal dependencies. Future optimizations may include caching and rate limiting to improve performance and reduce API usage.

### User Experience
The server is designed to provide a seamless experience for users, with automatic detection of repository information and sensible defaults for optional parameters. This approach minimizes the configuration required from users while maintaining flexibility.

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring compatibility with different Git hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Handling large repositories with many files efficiently
- Providing meaningful results for repositories with limited or no coverage data
- Balancing between automatic detection and user configuration

## Recent Decisions
- Decided to use the MCP SDK for server implementation
- Chose to implement automatic Git repository detection
- Opted for a simple API token authentication approach
- Decided to sort files by coverage percentage (ascending) to highlight the most critical areas
- Implemented customizable thresholds for minimum line count and coverage percentage
