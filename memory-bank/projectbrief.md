# Codecov MCP Server Project Brief

## Project Overview
The Codecov MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Codecov's API to identify files with low test coverage in a repository. It provides tools to help developers find areas of their codebase that need additional testing.

## Core Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to help developers quickly identify which files in their codebase have insufficient test coverage, allowing them to focus their testing efforts where they are most needed.

## Key Features
- **Git Repository Detection**: Automatically detects repository information from git remote
- **Codecov API Integration**: Connects to Codecov's API to retrieve coverage data
- **Low Coverage File Identification**: Identifies and ranks files with low test coverage
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Allows setting minimum line count and coverage thresholds
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Provides detailed logs for debugging and monitoring

## Target Users
- Developers using Codecov for test coverage analysis
- Teams looking to improve their test coverage
- CI/CD pipelines that need to identify areas with insufficient testing

## Use Cases
1. **Targeted Test Improvement**: Quickly identify which files need more tests
2. **Code Quality Monitoring**: Track which areas of the codebase have low test coverage
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Automatically flag files with insufficient coverage during builds
4. **Technical Debt Reduction**: Systematically address areas with poor test coverage

## Project Goals
- Provide a seamless integration between Claude and Codecov
- Minimize configuration requirements while maintaining flexibility
- Deliver accurate and actionable information about test coverage
- Support a variety of Git hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
