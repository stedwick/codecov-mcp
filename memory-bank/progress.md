# Codecov MCP Server Progress

## Current Status
The Codecov MCP Server is currently in a functional state with the core features implemented and tested. The server successfully integrates with Codecov's API to identify files with low test coverage and provides this information through the MCP protocol.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- âœ… MCP server implementation using the MCP SDK
- âœ… JSON-RPC communication with correct method names (`tools/list`, `tools/call`)
- âœ… Error handling with appropriate error codes and messages
- âœ… Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### Git Repository Detection
- âœ… Automatic detection of repository information from Git remote URLs
- âœ… Support for both HTTPS and SSH remote URL formats
- âœ… Identification of Git hosting service (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- âœ… Extraction of owner and repository name

### Codecov API Integration
- âœ… Connection to Codecov's API using API tokens
- âœ… Retrieval of coverage data for repositories
- âœ… Handling of API errors with informative messages

### Coverage Analysis
- âœ… Filtering of files based on minimum line count and coverage threshold
- âœ… Sorting of files by coverage percentage (ascending)
- âœ… Calculation of summary statistics (total files, average coverage)

### Testing
- âœ… Test scripts for verifying server functionality
- âœ… Mock Codecov API server for testing without actual API calls
- âœ… Verification of correct JSON-RPC method names

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
- The server currently relies on the local Git repository for detecting repository information, which may not be available in all environments.
- The server does not handle rate limiting for Codecov API requests, which could lead to rate limit errors with frequent use.
- Large repositories with many files may cause performance issues due to the amount of data being processed.

### Functional Limitations
- The server currently only supports a single tool (`find_low_coverage_files`) and does not provide more advanced functionality like flaky test detection.
- The server does not support comparing coverage between branches or over time.
- The server does not provide visualization capabilities for coverage data.

### Integration Challenges
- The server requires a Codecov API token, which may not be readily available to all users.
- The server assumes a certain structure for the Codecov API response, which may change in future API versions.
- The server is limited to the Git hosting services it can detect (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

## Next Steps

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all functions
2. Add support for additional Codecov API endpoints
3. Enhance error handling for edge cases
4. Create comprehensive API documentation

### Medium-term (1-2 months)
1. Implement flaky test detection tool
2. Add branch comparison functionality
3. Implement caching to reduce API calls
4. Add pagination for large repositories

### Long-term (3+ months)
1. Add visualization capabilities for coverage data
2. Implement comprehensive security features
3. Optimize performance for large repositories
4. Create user and developer guides
