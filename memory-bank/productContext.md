# Codecov MCP Server Product Context

## Problem Statement
Developers using Codecov for test coverage analysis often face challenges in identifying which specific files in their codebase most urgently need improved test coverage. While Codecov provides comprehensive coverage data, it can be time-consuming to manually sift through this information to determine where testing efforts should be prioritized.

Key challenges include:
- Difficulty in quickly identifying files with the lowest coverage
- Manual effort required to analyze coverage reports
- Lack of integration between Codecov and AI assistants like Claude
- Need for customizable thresholds based on project requirements

## Solution Overview
The Codecov MCP Server addresses these challenges by providing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Codecov's API to automatically identify files with low test coverage. The server exposes a tool that Claude can use to retrieve and present this information to users in a clear, actionable format.

The solution:
- Automatically detects Git repository information
- Connects to Codecov's API to retrieve coverage data
- Analyzes the data to identify files with low coverage
- Ranks files by coverage percentage to highlight the most critical areas
- Provides customizable thresholds for minimum line count and coverage percentage

## User Experience Goals
The Codecov MCP Server aims to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience:

1. **Minimal Configuration**: Users should only need to provide their Codecov API token, with other parameters being optional or automatically detected.

2. **Natural Language Interaction**: Users can ask Claude questions like "What files in my repository have low test coverage?" and receive meaningful responses.

3. **Actionable Information**: Results should clearly identify which files need attention, with relevant metrics to guide decision-making.

4. **Flexibility**: Users should be able to customize thresholds and parameters to match their project's specific requirements.

5. **Transparency**: The system should provide clear information about how it's retrieving and analyzing data.

## Key Benefits
